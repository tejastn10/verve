## **[Bug Title]**

### **Description**

Provide a concise and clear description of the bug. Include what the issue is, where it occurs, and its impact. Focus on describing **what is happening** rather than what should be happening.

---

### **Steps to Reproduce**

Provide step-by-step instructions to replicate the bug. Be as specific as possible. Example:

1. Go to `[specific page/module]`.
2. Click on `[specific button/action]`.
3. Observe `[specific outcome]`.

---

### **Expected Behavior**

Describe what should have happened if the bug were not present. This helps in understanding the gap between the actual and desired behavior.

---

### **Actual Behavior**

Describe what actually happens when the bug occurs. Include any error messages, incorrect outputs, or unexpected results.

---

### **Environment**

Detail the environment in which the bug was observed. Include the following:

- **Platform**: [e.g., Web, Mobile, Desktop]
- **Operating System**: [e.g., Windows 11, macOS Ventura, Ubuntu 22.04]

---

### **Screenshots/Logs**

Attach any screenshots, screen recordings, or logs that demonstrate the issue. Use code blocks for logs, e.g.: `[Error] Failed to fetch API: Timeout error`

---

### **Impact**

Explain the severity and scope of the issue:

- **Severity**: [e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low]
- **Scope**: Does it affect a single user, a specific feature, or the entire system?

---

### **Possible Fix (Optional)**

If you have any insights or suspect the root cause of the issue, describe them here. For example:

- "The bug might be caused by a missing null check on the API response."
- "The CSS class for the button appears to be overwritten."

---

### **References (Optional)**

- Link to relevant issues, logs, or pull requests.
- Add references to documentation or code snippets if applicable.

---

### **Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] The error no longer appears when performing `[specific action]`.
- [ ] The feature works as expected across supported environments.
- [ ] Automated tests are added to prevent regression.
